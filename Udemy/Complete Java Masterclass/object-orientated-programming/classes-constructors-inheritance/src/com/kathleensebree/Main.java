   * Course Notes
   * ------------------------------------
   * - Objects are digital representations of state and behavior from real world concepts, people, species, and objects.
   * - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support
   * - access modifiers -> public, private, protected, and default
   * - Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables)
   *   and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
   * - All Classes inherient the Object Class
