  /**
   * Course NOTES: Expressions, statements, code blocks, methods, and more.
   * - java has 50 reserved words
   * - can't use reserved words as variable names.
   * - Expressions are essentially building blocks of all Java programs. i.e. myVar = 50
   * - Statement is the complete line of code. i.e. int myVar = 50;
   * - overloading: using the same method signature except with a different number of parameters or different parameter data types
